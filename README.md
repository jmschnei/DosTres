# Document Structure Recognition System (DoStReS – dostres)

This service is responsible for the recognition of the structure of scientific documents. 


## Installation
The service is available as a docker image that can be downloaded from gitlab: URL.

## Usage 

The document structure recognition can be used through a REST API Controller, which can be used to recognize the structure of scientific articles.


### REST API Controler 

To use directly the flask controller, the repository has to be cloned. Once the code is available, we have to install the requirements. Then, the flask controller must be run. The follolwing commands perform all these tasks:

```
git clone 
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 
```

Once the controller is running, we can execute it using the following command:

```
curl ..........
```

## Roadmap
The plan is to finish the first minimum viable prototype in Q1 2025. After that, there is no concrete planning for further developments.
